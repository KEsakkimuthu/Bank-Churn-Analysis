# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn data using Power BI. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.
## ⚙️ Process Overview

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Gather customer demographic and transaction data from the bank’s database.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, and data types).
   - Engineer features relevant to churn prediction (e.g., age bracket, product count, tenure group).

2. **Data Import into Power BI**
   - Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI Desktop.
   - Set up data relationships and model the data as needed.

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Create interactive visuals for churn rate, age groups, credit score, tenure, product usage, gender, and country.
   - Build filters and slicers to allow dynamic exploration of the data.
   - Design summary cards for key metrics (total customers, churned customers, churn rate)
